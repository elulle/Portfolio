$content = "<p>I'm not much of a writer. I don't really share much about my holidays / travels apart from sharing an album or two on Facebook. But now that Wi-Fi has gone down for the whole day, I guess I will try write my first blog.</p><br>
			<p>In an office coding away day in day out, same routine for a year, I got a bit restless. Don't get me wrong I enjoy coding and I enjoyed my work friends and workplace. Many people are happy with that comfortable lifestyle, knowing that they will get a pay check at the end of the month - I was too! However, sitting at a desk every single day, just watching the time pass by - I just couldn't do it anymore.  I knew there was so much more to this world, this life I am meant to live and explore. It's up to me to actually act upon it. Taking action on something that is unknown felt complex. How can I act on something that doesn't yet exist? </p><br>

			<p>Developing my future from the actions I take in the present. But if I don't take any action then my future will be the same as the present. It was time to disturb my current life, for a different future, maybe even a better one. This was the risk I was willing to take to explore the unknown.</p><br>
			<p>So, I thought about going travelling for a bit. At first it was quite scary; quitting your job, no income, not seeing your friends, being on the other side of the world not knowing what to expect. </p><br>
			<p>It seemed unreal. </p><br>
			<p>To make it more real I started telling friends about my potential plans for travelling, I even started telling people who I just met. Their support and encouragement started making it more into a reality. I can't really go back to all my friends and be like:</p><br>
			<p'I kind of chickened out from travelling, so I'm not going anymore!'<p><br>
			<p>Then one weekend, I woke up, felt motivated and booked my plane tickets to Latvia via Barcelona (cheaper that way) with no return. The journey started from there...</p><br>
			<p>Told my manager I won't be carrying on my contract for the next year - I'm going travelling. That's it, no turning back now.</p><br>
			<p>I have a friend in Barcelona and Mallorca, so I contacted them about potentially meeting up. Another friend also mentioned that I can go with them to India, to visit their family. So the ball started rolling, my travels looked more realistic, but for how long will I go and where will I go? I had no idea.</p><br>";
