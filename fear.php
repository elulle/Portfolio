$content = "<p>Fear is everywhere, it stops you from doing what you want, stops your from reaching your full potential – that is why you need to learn to love it! If you are afraid of heights, go skydiving, if you are scared of public speaking, do as many speeches in front of as many people as possible.  Do not let Fear stop you from living. Afraid of the unknown? Go explore, connect with people and nature; you never know the experiences and friends you will make on the way. I’ve seen and experienced things that I could not have imagined before my travels.</p>
			<br><p>When I arrived in Legazpi to my first Voluntary project, they gave me an option of where to sleep:</p><br>
			<ol><li>Outside with the dogs on a bamboo bed with mosquito net, no toilet</li><li>In a small room inside a house, with toilet</li></ol>
			<br><p>To push my comfort zone I chose the first option. It seemed fun and fresh and made me think about the simplicity of life.</p>

			<p>To keep pushing myself, to further fall in love with my fear of not having my comfort zone, of being in the middle of nowhere and lost within a culture / country I decided to go to a remote island that even the locals hadn’t heard of. Fear was slowly bubbling up inside me, you hear so many bad stories and incidents, just got to trust it won’t happen to you. After all, you can’t be wrapped up your life!</p>
			<br><p>I met this stranger, Alan, who decided, last minute, to take a leap of faith, to love his fears and come to this island with me. The morning of departure, to stir up our fear a bit more, a Typhoon is coming our way in the next 24 hours, all boats are cancelled today and for the next 3 days! However, we managed to get a small private boat to take us. Not going past the coast guards, the 4 of us (2 boats men, my new friend and I) on a small wooden bamboo boat sailed of for about 4/5 hours through the waves, and the different looks in each other’s eyes. Our feet finally went through the clearest blue waters onto the most golden fresh sand – We made it! Yes, you probably think we are stupid, that we are lucky to be alive, but that’s life, all full of luck, missed opportunities, fears. You have to take control of your fear to allow you to live life fully!</p>

			<br><p>Many people fear people, which is strange because you don’t normally fear yourself. So why fear others? Watching the sunset in Manila, I was approached by two street kids asking for money. I’ve seen many people angrily say no, and walk off, they don’t give a chance to listen to them. I know money is bad to give, encourages them to keep asking, so I said I don’t have any. Next they asked if they could have the crisps I’m eating, I took a couple more crisps and gave the rest to them, encouraging them to share the packet. Simple acts of kindness can have bigger impact than you think.</p>

			<br><p>One night sleeping on the beach, with just a towel and hoody, 7 young Filipinos approach us. Your unconscious instincts assumes they are here to rob you, hassle you etc. But instead, they ended up lying next to us, singing love songs and practising their English.  You never know who you might meet, who might become your friend, what impact you could have on their lives. So be open minded and take the chance to speak to others.</p>
			
			<br><p>Alan asked me ‘What is your biggest fear?’</p>
			<br><p>I stopped, and paused… I couldn’t think of one…</p>
			<br><p>He smiled and said ‘I know – You fear going back’	</p>

			<br><p>He was right, a month ago I feared going back to the UK, now I still fear going back, but my mind is prepared and a part of me is looking forward to it. </p>";
