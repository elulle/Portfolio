$content = "<p>I had this great idea, well okay it wasn’t my idea. I just thought I would copy what thousands of travellers do – have a travel blog website. However, the only part of my website that I have been able to keep up to date is my current location; that’s nice and simple for both me to do and you to understand. I created my <a class='orange' href='first_blog.php'>first blog </a> a few months into travelling and that was surprisingly easy. I just wrote about how I felt and how I decided to go travelling.</p><br>
<p>However the thought of blogging about all the new things I have done, the foods I’ve tasted, the situations I have landed myself in, all the countries I’ve visited and how amazing and different all the locals have been seemed daunting in a way. There is so much to say and explain I could probably write a book if I went into enough detail – but I didn’t want to. </p><br>
<p>The main thing that bothered me about writing these blogs is the thought of you spending your time reading my blogs and yet you will never fully understand what I’ve been through or what I was trying to explain. Maybe that is because I’m a bad writer, but maybe it’s because an experience can never be fully re-lived or explained to what it deserves to be portrayed as. Even pictures, I look at some pictures and I can imagine the experience so much clearer and better in my head. Sometimes it’s the opposite, I create an amazing picture but actually the place wasn’t that special, just a bit photogenic. Don’t worry eventually I might post some pictures on here so you are not left completely in the dark about my 7 months abroad. </p><br>

<p>This blog is a lot easier to write than if I was writing about my travels, maybe this is just me ranting on or letting out my thoughts. I prefer this way of blogging than tying to replicate all the millions of blogs online about the South East Asia Loop. You should always do what you want to do, not what is expected of you. I know, so cliché but so true. How else will you grow and develop yourself if you do what others want you to do. This is your life to live, and only yours. Don’t get me wrong I am not saying you shouldn’t listen to people’s advice and opinions - please do! Learn and enrich yourself but always ask yourself what your opinion is on the matter, it is your choice and only your choice to decide whether to take on board others opinions or to let them go.  </p><br>
<p>To anyone who wants to start blogging I would really suggest to blog about something that you want to and feel like writing about. If you are struggling to write something for your blog then you need to find a new topic.<br> </p>";
